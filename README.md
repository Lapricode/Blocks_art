Draw with blocks of pixels on a grid of blocks.

As the title suggests, this program gives you the opportunity to draw with blocks of pixels on a grid of blocks üòè. The drawing is executed in a binary manner, which means that every pixel is either on or off. There are for menus with plenty of options:\n
a) Make grid menu: Here you can create a new grid or change the structure of the current grid.
b) Main menu: Here you can make changes to the grid as a whole and save or load your drawings.
c) Blocks editor menu: Here you can make changes to specific grid blocks of your interest and transfer the changes to the main grid.
d) Blocks info menu: Here you can print the grid blocks in a binary way and also print arduino instructions for arduino lcd display. As a matter of fact this was the main idea of the project. This option of course works well for grids that correspond to real arduino lcd displays.
